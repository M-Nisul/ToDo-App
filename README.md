# ToDo-App
Origin of the project :- I wanted to see how much I have learned through leetcode and youtube from the past couple of days and so the project was born. 
The journey :- Of course the first part was the easiest. I wrote the HTML code easily and struggled a bit with the designing stuff but I think I did good as an ameteur. This project made me realize that just learning syntax wasn't enough I needed to awaken my debugger's eye and get an understanding of computal thinking and problem solving.
P.S :- There might be a lot of icons in img section and some are not used in the project...Sorry about thatðŸ˜….
Thanks To :- The animated checkmark was from Icons8.
